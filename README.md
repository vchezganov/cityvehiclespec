# CityVehicleSpec

> :warning: It is the **DRAFT**. It is not complete and there are errors. It is just an idea how it could be done.

**CityVehicleSpec** is the specification for public transit data (stops, routes, timetables, etc) and mobility data (personal or shared scooters, bikes, cars, etc).
It is an attempt to improve and join two specifications GTFS and GBFS into one.

# Specification

Full specification can be found under [https://vchezganov.github.io/cityvehiclespec/](https://vchezganov.github.io/cityvehiclespec/).

# Remarks

The specification is not final and can be changed. Only versions starting from **1.0.0** are eligible to be considered as stable.


Fill free to contribute any improvements, fixes or extensions.
